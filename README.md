# Movie-Recommender

1) Downlaod the Dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
We will use the file 'movie_metadata.csv' for this project.

2) Dependencies:
- Python 3.6 or above
 Libraries Used (Use latest versions of all):
- NLTK
- Scikit Learn
- Regular Expression (re)
- JSON (json)
- Numpy
- Pandas

3) To run the program: python recommend.py --> Gives top 3 recommendations (Make sure csv file and script are in same folder)

Note: For the sake of speed (old laptop cannot handle so much) I have used the first 5000 movies. You can easily change this to use all the rows by simply removing the nrows = 5000 option while reading the csv file. This will give much better results to the already decent results with the smaller dataset.

4) I have also added a report regarding the implementation with a critical analysis and a video showing the working.
